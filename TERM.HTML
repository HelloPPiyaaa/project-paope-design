        <ol>
            <li><b>Acceptance of the General Conditions of Sale and conclusion of the contract</b></li>
            <p>1.1 The contract stipulated between FiloBlu Spa (hereinafter referred to as "FiloBlu") and the Client (that is the party or individual who makes 
                the purchase on the Website, not attributable to their commercial, business or professional activity) shall be concluded with the acceptance, 
                including partial acceptance, of the order by FiloBlu. Should the order not be accepted, FiloBlu shall in any case provide prompt notification to 
                the Client. <br>
                1.2 By placing an order through one of the available methods, according to the order form on the Website (hereinafter referred to as the "Order"), 
                the Client confirms having read all the information provided during the purchase process and confirms full acceptance of these General Conditions 
               (hereinafter referred to as the "Conditions"). <br>
               1.3 These Conditions may be printed or saved on a durable medium, in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of Italian 
               Legislative Decree 70/2003 and Article 51 of Italian Legislative Decree 206/2005, as amended by Italian Legislative Decree 21/2014. <br>
               1.4 FiloBlu shall arrange to refund the Client for the whole amount paid, net of consignment charges incurred and any customs duty paid 
                for importation, within 14 days from the date of cancellation, by transferring the debited amount, via the same payment method used by 
                the Client for the initial transaction, unless otherwise agreed. In any case, the Client shall not bear any expenses incurred as a consequence 
                of said refund. FiloBlu may withhold the refund until the returned product is received or until such time as the Client can prove that the product 
                has been properly dispatched, whichever is sooner.
          </p>
          <li><b>Purchase method</b></li>
          <p>
            2.1 The only products offered for sale by FiloBlu are those shown on FiloBlu's website at the time of placing the Order, as they are described on 
            the relevant information pages. <br>
            2.2 However, it shall be understood that the images accompanying the information regarding a product are shown for information purposes only 
            and may not be wholly representative of the product's features, possibly differing, for example, in colour and size (in some cases due to the browser 
            and screen used to access the Website and view the images). <br>
            2.3 To place an Order, the Client must fully complete the relevant form on the Website and send the same after carefully reading the Conditions as well 
            as the features of the product and/or products that the Client intends to purchase. The Client shall also ask FiloBlu, if desired, to send a tax invoice 
            for the purchase, pursuant to Article 22 of Italian Presidential Decree no. 633/1972. <br>
            2.4 Correct receipt of the Order shall be confirmed by FiloBlu by means of a reply via email sent to the email address indicated by the Client. Said 
            confirmation message shall include a summary of the purchase conditions, in accordance with applicable regulations, as well as the details provided 
            by the Client on the Order, so that the Client may check said details and communicate any necessary corrections without delay.

          <li><b>Prices and Payment Methods</b></li>
          <p>From 28 December 2020, online payments have become even safer thanks to the new European PSD2 legislation introducing new anti-fraud rules. <br> <br>
            <b>What changes?</b> <br>
            Now, when you place an online order and use your credit card as payment method, your bank may ask you to confirm your identity using 3D Secure 
            authentication. <br><br>
            <b>What is 3-D Secure authentication used for and how does it work?</b><br>
            3-D Secure authentication reduces the number of fraudulent online activities including identity theft and unauthorised use of cards. It protects cardholder 
            data and reduces fraud attempts. <br>
            There are several ways to authenticate online payments, depending on which one your bank has decided to use. You may be asked to confirm your identity 
            by SMS, email or via TouchID on your smartphone. <br>
            We recommend you to contact your bank to make sure they have your correct contact details in case they ask you to use SMS or email for 3D Secure 
            authentication. <br>
            We also recommend you create your Account, , save your credit card details to do shopping in our online shop easier and faster. <br>
            If you have any questions, please contact our Customer Care <br>
            3.1 The prices indicated on the Website shall be understood as inclusive of taxes and VAT.  Any delivery costs or payment charges shall in any case be notified to the Client via the Website or through these Conditions. <br>

            by FiloBlu. <br>
            Under no circumstances and at no stage of the transaction shall FiloBlu be able to access the Client's credit card details, which shall be transmitted 
            through a secure connection directly to the banking institute that manages the transaction.  No electronic record of said details shall be held by FiloBlu 
            and therefore under no circumstances shall FiloBlu be held liable for any fraudulent and unauthorised use of credit cards by third parties at the time of payment. <br>
            (iii) Bank Transfer (only for european countires) <br>
            In case of purchase with bank transfer, the Client can find the bank coordinate. The goods will be shipped only after the actual receiving of the payment <br>

                4.1 The products purchased shall be delivered to the address indicated on the Order by the Client within 24-48 hours from FiloBlu having accepted the Order, at the cost specifically indicated on the Website before placing the Order. FiloBlu reserves the right to accept or refuse requests for 
                delivery beyond the territories of Italy or Europe. In any case, for deliveries outside the territories of Italy, delivery expenses and lead times

                restrictions on imports. <br>
                4.3 The lead times for delivery indicated by FiloBlu are merely indicative and a delay to the same, or any delivery made with subsequent split consignments

                that the number of packages delivered corresponds to the number shown on the delivery note.
                that the packaging is intact, not damaged, or wet or spoiled, including with reference to the materials used for sealing (adhesive tape or metallic 
                strapping). <br>

                <b>NOTE:</b>It is not possible to request a change or a refund of a customized product, unless the goods are not defective or not in compliance with the order

                immediately by indicating the nature of the problem on the delivery note for the product, which shall be returned to the carrier. 

                Any problems with reference to the physical integrity, correspondence or completeness of the goods received must be notified within 7 days of delivery, 
                in accordance with the methods set out in this document.

            <p>
                5.1 All products sold by FiloBlu are covered by a warranty of 24 (twenty-four) months for any lack of conformity pursuant to Chapter III of Italian 
                Legislative Decree 206/2005. To benefit from assistance under the warranty, the Client must retain the invoice or the payment receipt, along with 
                the delivery note. <br>

                5.2 The warranty for lack of conformity shall be applicable provided that the product concerned has been used correctly, in accordance with its intended 
                use and in compliance with the contents of the instructions for usage and laundering provided in and/or with the product. <br>
                5.3 Should FiloBlu, for any reason, not be able to provide the Client with a product under the warranty (repaired or replaced), or should repair or 
                replacement be excessively burdensome, due to the value of the product, FiloBlu may proceed by applying an appropriate discount on the price paid, 
                or by refunding the whole amount paid and terminating the contract. <br>
                5.4 Where the implementation of the warranty requires the product to be returned, the same must be returned by the Client in its original packaging, 
                complete in all its parts (including packaging and any documentation and accessories).
